# Real-time-Data-Plotting-with-Arduino

This project shows how to create live graphs using Python's matplotlib library and an Arduino.This project combines hardware and software to create live data visualization. Using an Arduino microcontroller connected to sensors, we can measure real-world data and display it instantly on a computer screen through continuously updating graphs.

Setup: 
1. An Arduino microcontroller collects temperature and voltage measurements from sensors
2. These readings are sent from the Arduino to a computer 
3. The computer uses matplotlib library of Python to display these measurements as graphs that update automatically as new data comes in

These real-time graphs can be used in other applications ,such as noticing how the stock markets update throughout the trading day.
